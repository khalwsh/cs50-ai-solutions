Q1) BFS will sometimes, but not always, find a shorter path than DFS

As if the cost not equal then BFS will produces some wrong ans like shortest path in graph with different cost
per edge in this case bfs not generated optimal answer and we need an algorithm like dijkstra.

Q2) DFS ONLY

all other types should at least make one red cell more.
dfs could take any path it like

Q3) Depth-limited minimax can arrive at a decision more quickly because it explores fewer states

this is the only sure thing cause the not limited have the optimal answer always but the limited not always
optimal so it's not preferable in all cases and somecases is perferable like chess 

Q4) 5

because the red try to minize the ans so {5,1,2} is the set for the root to choose from and it chooses 5 cause 
it is the bigger one.
